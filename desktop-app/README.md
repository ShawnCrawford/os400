# OS400 Desktop Client

This package houses the Electron + Vite + React desktop shell for the AS/400-inspired CRM experience. It provides a native-feeling, keyboard-friendly workspace that mirrors the two-pane layout defined in the project vision while remaining portable across macOS and Linux.

## Tech Stack

- **Electron 30** for cross-platform desktop packaging and access to native capabilities.
- **Vite 5 + React 18 + TypeScript** for a fast, modular renderer that can evolve into the AS/400-style split workspace.
- **Electron Builder** for generating production installers when we are ready to distribute builds.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script launches the Vite development server and attaches the Electron main process with hot module replacement. Changes made under `src/` will reload instantly in the renderer window.

## Building Distributables

```bash
npm run build
```

The build pipeline type-checks the project, creates production bundles for the renderer and main processes, and invokes Electron Builder to produce platform-specific artifacts. macOS and Linux binaries can be created from the same codebase.

## Next Steps

- Implement the numeric launch menu and routing into CRM modules.
- Build the two-pane layout components with pane-swapping controls for client context and journal activity.
- Integrate with the service layer defined in the broader project roadmap (authentication, data access, reporting).

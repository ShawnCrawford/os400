# os400-ver-2

## Project Overview
This project reimagines an AS/400-inspired CRM for modern desktop users, emphasizing efficient keyboard-driven workflows, dense information layouts, and contextual actions that mirror legacy function-key behavior while delivering a polished native experience. The roadmap targets inside sales, account management, support, and operations teams with capabilities for lead management, customer records, ticketing, and analytics. See the [CRM Modernization Vision](docs/vision.md) for detailed user personas, use cases, interaction design goals, roadmap milestones, and integration dependencies as we progress from desktop delivery to future web experiences.

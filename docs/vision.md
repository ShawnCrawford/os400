# CRM Modernization Vision

## Target Users
- **Inside sales representatives** who need fast access to lead and opportunity details during high-volume outreach.
- **Account managers and customer success teams** responsible for maintaining customer records, renewal cycles, and ongoing service requests.
- **Support desk agents** managing inbound tickets and coordinating escalations with technical teams.
- **Operations leadership** requiring visibility into pipeline health, customer satisfaction trends, and team productivity metrics.

## Primary CRM Use Cases
- **Lead management:** capture inbound leads, prioritize follow-up, and track conversion from qualification through closure.
- **Customer records:** maintain a 360° profile including contact details, contract history, communication logs, and related documents.
- **Ticketing and case management:** log customer issues, assign ownership, track progress, and maintain an auditable resolution history.
- **Task and workflow automation:** schedule follow-ups, reminders, and approval flows informed by data captured in the system.
- **Reporting and analytics:** generate dashboards for sales velocity, support SLAs, customer health scores, and operational KPIs.

## Translating the AS/400 Workflow
- **Retain structured, keyboard-driven efficiency:** adopt navigable command palettes, keyboard shortcuts, and structured data entry forms reminiscent of green-screen workflows.
- **Modern information density:** use tabbed detail panes and collapsible sections to show dense information without overwhelming the user.
- **Contextual actions:** surface next-step actions aligned with AS/400 function keys, modernized into customizable action bars and right-click menus.
- **Desktop-first implementation:** deliver a native desktop experience (Electron or .NET MAUI) that mirrors the predictable, low-latency behavior of legacy terminals.
- **Future web extension:** plan a responsive web client that reuses core services and presents the same workflows optimized for browser-based interactions and mobile access.
